	{"title":"In The Old Theatre, Fiesole (April, 1887)","content":"I traced the Circus whose gray stones incline \nWhere Rome and dim Etruria interjoin, \nTill came a child who showed an ancient coin \nThat bore the image of a Constantine. \n\nShe lightly passed; nor did she once opine \nHow, better than all books, she had raised for me \nIn swift perspective Europe's history \nThrough the vast years of Caesar's sceptred line. \n\nFor in my distant plot of English loam \n'Twas but to delve, and straightway there to find \nCoins of like impress. As with one half blind \nWhom common simples cure, her act flashed home \nIn that mute moment to my opened mind \nThe power, the pride, the reach of perished Rome.","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/thomas-hardy\/in-the-old-theatre-fiesole-april-1887","poet":{"name":"Thomas Hardy","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/thomas-hardy"}},{"title":"Joy And Peace In Believing","content":"Sometimes a light surprises \nThe Christian while he sings; \nIt is the Lord who rises \nWith healing on His wings; \nWhen comforts are declining, \nHe grants the soul again \nA season of clear shining, \nTo cheer it after rain. \n\nIn holy contemplation \nWe sweetly then pursue \nThe theme of God's salvation, \nAnd find it ever new; \nSet free from present sorrow, \nWe cheerfully can say, \nE'en let the unknown to-morrow \nBring with it what it may! \n\nIt can bring with it nothing, \nBut He will bear us through; \nWho gives the lilies clothing, \nWill clothe His people too; \nBeneath the spreading heavens \nNo creature but is fed; \nAnd He who feeds the ravens \nWill give His children bread. \n\nThough vine nor fig tree neither \nTheir wonted fruit shall bear, \nThough all the field should wither, \nNor flocks nor herds be there: \nYet God the same abiding, \nHis praise shall tune my voice; \nFor, while in Him confiding, \nI cannot but rejoice.","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/william-cowper\/joy-and-peace-in-believing","poet":{"name":"William Cowper","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/william-cowper"}},{"title":"Rumi","content":"I escaped from the city\nbarefooted. I escaped from the fires\n\nnaked, except for the bag\nof ancient books\n\nslung over my back.\nI ran into the desert. The horsemen\n\nchased. Their torches\nhad coloured the tenements.\n\nI ran for months. Finally\non a glorious night\n\nI stopped. The raiders had given up\non me. I was alone\n\nwith the moon and the sand-dunes.\nI looked down at my feet.\n\nThey were skinned.\nI looked at my trace: red footprints\n\ndark on the glowing plain.\nI thought about my tribe\n\nbutchered as sacrificial beasts.\nI remembered their smiles\n\nbefore the flames. On the holy night\nI knelt before the moon\n\nand wept. In the desert\ntears are elixir. From their pool\n\na fountain bubbled. I cleaned my scars\nin the water. The books\n\nweighed on my body. I took them out\nand one by one\n\ndipped them into the spring.\nAll knowledge, all art, and all history\n\ndrowned before my eyes. Freed\nfrom the clutch of paper\n\nwords\u2019 ink dissolved in the lake.\nI then drank. I was saved.","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/ali-alizadeh\/rumi","poet":{"name":"Ali Alizadeh","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/ali-alizadeh"}},{"title":"Each Day Lord, Please Let Me Do Good For Others","content":"Lord in our prayers, we often ask for many\n material things\n\n The majority of the time, we are asking for\n money for our own personal gain.\n\n We ask you to continuously forgive us for\n our wrong doing; but we keep doing wrong.\n And you keep on forgiving us until the\n judgement comes.\n\n Hence, I am asking you personally, each\n day Lord, please let me do good for\n others.\n\n Let my mind catch the essence of the\n universe to help me support others in\n a more meaningful way.\n\n To help mortal man live with himself\n and others in a more peaceful\n and harmonious way.\n\n Peace Be Still!","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/nora-belle-bynum\/each-day-lord-please-let-me-do-good-for-others","poet":{"name":" Nora Belle Bynum","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/nora-belle-bynum"}},{"title":"The Companions","content":"Three grey women walk with me \nFate and Grief and Memory. \n\nMy fate brought grief; my grief must be \nWith me through Eternity, \nSuch thy power, memory.\nThree grey women walk with me.","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/adelaide-crapsey\/the-companions","poet":{"name":"Adelaide Crapsey","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/adelaide-crapsey"}},

No matter the time or ken,\nThere never was separate heart-beat in all the races of men!\n\nBut alien is one\u2014of class, not race\u2014he has drawn the line for himself; \nHis roots drink life from inhuman soil, from garbage of pomp and pelf;\nHis heart beats not with the common beat, he has changed his life-stream's hue; \nHe deems his flesh to be finer flesh, he boasts that his blood is blue:\nPatrician, aristocrat, tory\u2014whatever his age or name, \nTo the people's rights and liberties, a traitor ever the same. \nThe natural crowd is a mob to him, their prayer a vulgar rhyme; \nThe freeman's speech is sedition, and the patriot's deed a crime. \nWherever the race, the law, the land,\u2014whatever the time, or throne, \nThe tory is always a traitor to every class but his own.\n\nThank God for a land where pride is clipped, where arrogance stalks apart;\nWhere law and song and loathing of wrong are words of the common heart;\nWhere the masses honor straightforward strength, and know, when veins are bled,\nThat the bluest blood is putrid blood\u2014that the people's blood is red!\n\nAnd honor to Crispus Attucks, who was leader and voice that day; \nThe first to defy, and the first to die, with Maverick. Carr, and Gray. \nCall it riot or revolution, his hand first clenched at the crown; \nHis feet were the first in perilous place to pull the king's flag down; \nHis breast was the first one rent apart that liberty's stream might flow; \nFor our freedom now and forever, his head was the first bid low.\n\nCall it riot or revolution, or mob or crowd, as you may, \nSuch deaths have been seed of nations, such lives shall be honored for aye. \nThey were lawless hinds to the lackeys\u2014but martyrs to Paul Revere;\nAnd Otis and Hancock and Warren read spirit and meaning clear. \nYe teachers, answer: what shall be done when just men stand in the dock; \nWhen the caitiff is robed in ermine, and his sworders keep the lock; \nWhen torture is robbed of clemency, and guilt is without remorse; \nWhen tiger and panther are gentler than the Christian slaver's curse; \nWhen law is a satrap's menace, and order the drill of a horde\u2014 \nShall the people kneel to be trampled, and bare their neck to the sword?\n\nNot so! by this Stone of Resistance that Boston raises here!\nBy the old North Church's lantern, and the watching of Paul Revere!\nNot so! by Paris of 'Ninety-Three, and Ulster of 'NinetyEight!\nBy Toussaint in St. Domingo! by the horror of Delhi's gate!\nBy Adams's word to Hutchinson! by the tea that is brewing still!\nBy the farmers that met the soldiers at Concord and Bunker Hill!\n\nNot so! not so! Till the world is done, the shadow of wrong is dread; \nThe crowd that bends to a lord to-day, to-morrow shall strike him dead.\nThere is only one thing changeless: the earth steals from under our feet, \nThe times and manners are passing moods, and the laws are incomplete; \nThere is only one thing changes not, one word that still survives\u2014 \nThe slave is the wretch who wields the lash, and not the man in gyves!\n\nThere is only one test of contract: is it willing, is it good? \nThere is only one guard of equal right: the unity of blood; \nThere is never a mind unchained and true that class or race allows;\nThere is never a law to be obeyed that reason disavows; \nThere is never a legal sin but grows to the law's disaster, \nThe master shall dropp the whip, and the slave shall enslave the master!\n\nO, Planter of seed in thought and deed has the year of right revolved, \nAnd brought the Negro patriot's cause with its problem to be solved? \nHis blood streamed first for the building, and through all the century's years,\nOur growth of story and fame of glory are mixed with his blood and tears. \nHe lived with men like a soul condemned\u2014derided, defamed, and mute;\nDebased to the brutal level, and instructed to be a brute. \nHis virtue was shorn of benefit, his industry of reward; \nHis love!\u2014O men, it were mercy to have cut affection's cord; \nThrough the night of his woe, no pity save that of his fellow-slave; \nFor the wage of his priceless labor, the scourging block and the grave!\n\nAnd now, is the tree to blossom? Is the bowl of agony filled? \nShall the price be paid, and the honor said, and the word of outrage stilled? \nAnd we who have toiled for freedom's law, have we sought for freedom's soul? \nHave we learned at last that human right is not a part but the whole? \nThat nothing is told while the clinging sin remains part unconfessed? \nThat the health of the nation is periled if one man be oppressed?\n\nHas he learned\u2014the slave from the rice-swamps, whose children were sold\u2014has he, \nWith broken chains on his limbs, and the cry in his blood, 'I am free!' \nHas he learned through affliction's teaching what our Crispus Attucks knew\u2014 \nWhen Right is stricken, the white and black are counted as one, not two?\nHas he learned that his century of grief was worth a thousand years \nIn blending his life and blood with ours, and that all his toils and tears \nWere heaped and poured on him suddenly, to give him a right to stand \nFrom the gloom of African forests, in the blaze of the freest land? \nThat his hundred years have earned for him a place in the human van \nWhich others have fought for and thought for since the world of wrong began?\n\nFor this, shall his vengeance change to love, and his retribution burn,\nDefending the right, the weak and the poor, when each shall have his turn;\nFor this, shall he set his woeful past afloat on the stream of night; \nFor this, he forgets as we all forget when darkness turns to light; \nFor this, he forgives as we all forgive when wrong has changed to right.\n\nAnd so, must we come to the learning of Boston's lesson to-day; \nThe moral that Crispus Attucks taught in the old heroic way; \nGod made mankind to be one in blood, as one in spirit and thought; \nAnd so great a boon, by a brave man's death, is never dearly bought!","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/john-boyle-oreilly\/crispus-attucks","poet":{"name":"John Boyle O'Reilly","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/john-boyle-oreilly"}},{"title":"Give The Children A Better Chance","content":"Give the Children a better chance\n Let them learn to sing and dance\n Let them laugh and run to play\n Dare to dream of a brighter day\n Let them be forever free, forever free","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/billie-jeanne-james\/give-the-children-a-better-chance","poet":{"name":" Billie Jeanne James","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/billie-jeanne-james"}},{"title":"Last Time, I Think","content":"Last time, I think,\nI'll brush the flies\nfrom my father's face.\nTranslated by Robert Hass","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/kobayashi-issa\/last-time-i-think","poet":{"name":"Kobayashi Issa","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/kobayashi-issa"}},{"title":"Stupidity","content":"Dearest, forgive that with my clumsy touch\nI broke and bruised your rose.\nI hardly could suppose\nIt were a thing so fragile that my clutch\nCould kill it, thus.\n\nIt stood so proudly up upon its stem,\nI knew no thought of fear,\nAnd coming very near\nFell, overbalanced, to your garment's hem,\nTearing it down.\n\nNow, stooping, I upgather, one by one,\nThe crimson petals, all\nOutspread about my fall.\nThey hold their fragrance still, a blood-red cone\nOf memory.\n\nAnd with my words I carve a little jar\nTo keep their scented dust,\nWhich, opening, you must\nBreathe to your soul, and, breathing, know me far\nMore grieved than you.","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/amy-lowell\/stupidity","poet":{"name":"Amy Lowell","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/amy-lowell"}}
