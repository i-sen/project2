      This is a Mashups project created using p5.js and a poetry randomizer API. Most of the scenes include a slider which can be used to
      control various elements on the page, such as changing the color of snow or controlling a fractal tree. Some scenes have sound effects in line with what is 
      happening in the scene. The story follows an unnamed character walking through the woods, when he comes accross a girl. Over the course of the story we find out that the girl isn't real, and vanishes when she enters a lake. The character is a priest whose duty it is to absolve wandering souls of their guilt, which he does so in this case by bringing the girl to water. The mentions of burning wood and flesh allude to her being burnt alive, which is why he takes her to a lake. This story was inspired by the practice of Sati in India, and the recent cases of young girls being forced to immolate themselves on their husband's funeral pyre. In Hinduism, the soul is bonded to Earth if their spirit is not adequately blessed or cleansed after death.

      Some of my biggest issues while working on this were that I wrote the story first, and then tried to make p5 animations to fit it. However, I struggled to create fluid animations that matched what I had in mind, so I ended up reusing a number of scenes I created. Additionally, I was initially using a library which allowed me to use multiple p5 sketches in one js file. However, I soon realized that this wouldn't let me control individual elements on the page, so I ended up creating individual html and js files for every scene.

      My main goal with this project was to push the boundaries of how comfortable I am with p5, and to see if I could use it in a novel way. While I enjoyed the exercise, I'm not 100% satisfied with how the final product turned out, and can see lots of room for improvement.
